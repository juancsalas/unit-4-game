Assignment 4 - Crystal Game

This is a random number game.

You will be given a random number at the start of the game. 

There are five dino crystals below. By clicking on a dino crystal you will add a specific amount fo points to your total score. The value of each dino crystal is hidden from you until your click on it. 

Every time your total is updated, the program will compare the total to the target number to see if it's equal, under, over.

You win the game by matching your total score to random number, you lose the game if your total score goes above the random number.

Each time when the game starts, the game will change the values of each dino crystal but your wins and losses will remain intact.
